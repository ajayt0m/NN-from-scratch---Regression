# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch (Boston Housing)

This project builds a **simple feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy** to perform regression on the **Boston Housing dataset**. It demonstrates the fundamentals of how neural networks learn, including manual forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent — without using any deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🔹 Fully built from scratch using NumPy
- 🔹 Single hidden layer with ReLU activation
- 🔹 Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function
- 🔹 Manual backpropagation using the **chain rule**
- 🔹 Training loop with multiple epochs
- 🔹 Evaluation using MSE and R² score
